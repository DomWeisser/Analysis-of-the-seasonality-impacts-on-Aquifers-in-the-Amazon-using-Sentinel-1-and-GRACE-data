# Groundwater Monitoring and Analysis in the Alter do Chao Aquifer for 2019

# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and methodology for quantifying and analysing groundwater dynamics in the Alter do Chao Aquifer (Manaus, Brazil) 2019. By integrating sateliite remote sensing (Sentinel-1, GRACE), reanalysis products (GLDAS), and in-situ well measurments, I detect seasonal patterns in groundwater storage. 
Groundwater monitoring in large aquifer system are vitaly important to understanding the long-term water scarcity in regions tackling increasingly powerful droughts. The Alter do Chao Aquifer is one of Brazil's most important freshwater aquifers supplying water to __ people. 

## Data and Methods
# Study Area
The Alter do Chao aquifer is located in tge Amazon region of Brazil. It serves as a critical water resource for both human populations and ecological systems in the area. The aquifer is characterised by:
- Predominantly sandy formations
- Strong seasonal precipitation patterns
- Limited ground-based monitoring infrastructure

# Datasets
| Dataset | Source | Resolution | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sentinel-1 SAR | ESA | 10m spatial  | VH polarization backscatter data |
| GRACE | NASA JPL | 1° spatial  | Terrestrial water storage anomalies |
| GLDAS | NASA GSFC | 0.25° spatial  | Soil moisture, snow, canopy water components |
| Well Measurements | RIMAS (Brazil) | Point-based  | In-situ groundwater level measurements |

# Methodology
1. d










# Results
The analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns in groundwater storage with a rough 1-2 month delay.
